[h1]Work-in-progress quality warning[/h1]
This mod is currently in beta. Features may not work right. I play/test mostly in SW and Hamlet-compatible SW, other versions may have crash-inducing bugs. Please report these issues, after reading instructions in the bug report thread, linked below.


[h1][b][u]ActionQueue Reborn for Don't Starve[/u][/b][/h1]
This is a Don't Starve (Alone) port of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1608191708]eXiGe's ActionQueue Reborn[/url]. The additions made by eXiGe were too good to pass up in singleplayer, and DST ports of Shipwrecked and Hamlet content just don't cut it for me. So I decided to bring this rewritten and extended Action Queue to singleplayer.

Where applicable, the original mod's features should work in singleplayer in the same way. On top of these features, this singleplayer version adds the following:

[b]Shipwrecked, Hamlet actions added:[/b]
[list]
[*]Hacking
[*]Shearing
[*]Fishing-rod retrieving
[*]Disarming (only traps)
[*]Weighing down
[/list]

[b]New features[/b]
Stop conditions filter:
[list]
[*] Stop hacking tubertrees beyond regrowth
[*] Stop fuelling fires that are already full
[*] Stop giving item to pig trader that will refuse it
[/list]

[b]Planned features[/b]
[list]
[*]Autobuyer - automatically buy items that are restocked with identical item every time (ice, oincs, contracts...)
[*]Mimics - when autoselecting with double-click, don't help player distinguish between different prefabs using the same anim (i.e. winebush and snakeden).
[*]Entity morph - from eXiGe's AQR, handle entities that exchanged in-place when worked mined/hammered - spilagmite, ancient altar, etc.
[*] Search boat inventory to re-equip tools (mining coral) or active items (planting seaweed plants).
[/list]

[h1]Original Description[/h1]

This version of Action Queue has been completely rewritten with a focus on fixing all the underlying issues with the previous versions, optimizing and minimizing any performance impact, along with adding several new features. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=609051112]Action Queue DST[/url] ported by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198161551641]xiaoXzzz[/url] has been a great addition to my collection of mods, and it was only after using it for more than a year, that I decided I wanted to undertake fixing the few issues it had.

The original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=263658444]Action Queue[/url] for Don't Starve by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/nsimplex]simplex[/url], which was created in 2014, is an amazing mod that still sees much use in its various versions.
